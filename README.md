# Modified-Patankar-Oscillations-and-Lyapunov-Stability

This code refers to the work **A necessary condition for non oscillatory and positivity preserving time-integration schemes** by [Thomas Izgin](http://www.mathematik.uni-kassel.de/~izgin/publications.php?lang=en), [Philipp Ã–ffner](https://philippoeffner.de/), [Davide Torlo](https://davidetorlo.it)  available in [arXiv:2211.08905](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08905).

In this repository, there are the codes used for the [work for Modified Patankar schemes on the connection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08905) between oscillations studied in [Torlo et al. APNUM 182 (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnum.2022.07.014) and Lyapunov stability function studied in [Izgin et al. ESAIM: M2AN 56 (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1051/m2an/2022031).

The numerical study with the related results can be found in the Julia Jupyter Notebook [Oscillation Numerical Bound](<notebooks/Oscillations Numerical Bounds.ipynb>).

The stability functions and their stability regions are in the [Maple notebook](notebooks/StabilityFunctions.mw)
