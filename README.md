# Modified-Patankar-Oscillations-and-Lyapunov-Stability

In this repository, there are the codes used for the work on the connection for Modified Patankar schemes between oscillations studied in [Torlo et al. APNUM 182 (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnum.2022.07.014) and Lyapunov stability function studied in [Izgin et al. ESAIM: M2AN 56 (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1051/m2an/2022031).

The numerical study with the related results can be found in the Julia Jupyter Notebook [Oscillation Numerical Bound](notebooks/Oscillations\ Numerical\ Bounds.ipynb).

The stability functions and their stability regions are in the [Maple notebook](notebooks/file.mw)
